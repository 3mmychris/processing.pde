    <h2>Basic Info</h2>
    <!-- This paragraphis based on Animal fact encyclopedia -->
      <p>Our magnificent partner in crime, the domestic dog, has been living and bonding with human beings for 12,000 years or more.
         Although they work beside, and for us as well, their value to us as enriching companions has allowed them to flourish,<br>
         and caused modern humans to devote extraordinary resources to their well-being.
         Once considered to be a subspecies of grey wolf, recent DNA research shows that dogs and wolves have been evolving separately for more than 30,000 years,<br>
         and that the last common ancestor, a small (perhaps 40 pounds) Eurasian wolf, is now extinct.

         <em>All dogs, including wild dog species like the dingo, are more closely related to extinct wolves, than they are to any living wolf species.</em>
