    <h1>DEAR AFRICA</h1>
    <p>
      Your stories are foundaround fires <br>
      Over meals and handshakes <br>
      In street corners ans cornershops<br>
      In buses and backyards<br>
      In living rooms and classrooms<br>
      The tourist is not the only lens we use to see You<br>
      We use our neighbours eyes<br>
      And our forefathers tongues to look at you<br>
      You are recipes passed down generations and generations<br>
      You are centuries of traditions and legacies<br>
      You are libraries amd art centers<br>
      You are ulutations at weddding and multilingual hymns at funerals<br>
      You are complex and beautiful<br>
      You have many narratives<br>
      You are a fabric with many borders<br>
      That ask us where we come from and where we are going<br>
      We come from here and there<br>
      And then and how<br>
      We use the pages of yor histories<br>
      To map our own futures<br>
      We use your stories to see ourselves<br>
      And each other<br>
      Dear Africa<br>
      Our love for you<br>
      Unites us.
