    <h1>THE FIRST PROGRAMMER</h1>
    <p>
      Ada Lovelace has been called the world's first computer programmer. What she did was write the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper.<br> Of course, someone had to be the first, but Lovelace was a woman, and this was in the 1840s.
