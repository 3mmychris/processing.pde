      A wealthy man requested an old scholar to wean his <em>son</em> away from his<strong> bad habits</strong>.<br> The scholartook the youth for a stroll through a <em>garden</em>.<br> Stopping suddenly he asked the boy to <em>pull</em> <strong>out a slightly bigger plant</strong>.<br>
      The youth <em>pulled hard and the plant came out, roots and all</em>. <strong>"Now pull out that one."said the old man pointing to a bush</strong>.<br> The boy had to use all his strength to pull it out.<br>
      "<em>Now take this one out</em>," said he old man, <strong>indicating a guava tree</strong>. The youth grasped the <em>trunk</em> and tried to pull it out.<br> But it would not <strong>budge</strong>.<br> <em><strong>"It's impossible", said the boy, panting with the effort.<br></em></strong>
      So it is with bad habits, said the sage. <strong>When they are young it is easy to pull out but when the take hold they cannot be uprooted,"</strong>
    </p>

    <strong> Don't wait for <em>Bad Habits</em> to grow in you, drop them while you have control over it else they will get control of you.</strong>
